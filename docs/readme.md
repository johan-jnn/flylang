# Flylang

Welcome on the temporary documentation of the flylang programming language.
Here you'll learn on how to write, use and develop with flylang.

## Warning

This documentation is temporary and will surely be moved after I completetly finished the creation of this language.
Some informations can be missing.

> Language's version affected by this documentation: `0.0.1-beta`

## Content

- [Syntax of the language](./syntax/readme.md)
- [CLI](./cli/readme.md)
- [Package System](./packages/readme.md)

## Installation

Because the flylang language is still in work in progress, there is no downloadable version at this time.
But, if you want you can clone the rust's project on your computer and play with the non-finished version (at your own risk).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/johan-jnn/flylang.git
cd flylang
# Then edit the file at tests/misc.fly
cargo run
```
